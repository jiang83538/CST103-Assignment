__Attention__: All the answers should implement your own algorithms. In your answer to all of the
following exercises, appropriate comments should be provided for obscure or difficult code.

__Question 1__: Write a program that reads input until encountering #. Have the program print each
input character and its ASCII decimal code. Print eight character-code pairs per line. Suggestion:
Use a character count and the modulus operator (%) to print a newline character for every eight
cycles of the loop.

__Question 2__: Based on the 4.9 Grading System in XMUM student handbook, A studentâ€™s
performance in a course is represented by the grade they obtain. The table below lists the total
marks, corresponding grades, and grade points.

Write a GPA calculator that was programmed using the C programming language. The program
ask the user for input 5 courses marks that your take in this semester and do the calculation based
on the above formula and table, output the final GPA and related info for the grades entered. The
final output format as following:

__Couse code  Final mark  Grade Grade  Points  Description__
__Course #1__
__...__
__Course #5__
__The GPA of 202309 semester: __
